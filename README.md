# Project 2: Shiny App Development Version 2.0

![image](doc/MAP.png)

In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a version 2.0 of an *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app and our chosen topic is [college scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/). See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- study legacy codes and further development
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server

+ **Project summary**: 
	In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a version 2.0 of an *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app and our chosen topic is [college scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/). Find Your University 2.0  helps prospective college students find their ideal college match.   Whether they are in beginning stages or at the end, our app allows students to do side by side comparisons of admission stats, tuition costs, ranks, and campus information in one place allowing students to focus on the application. This app is an update and expansion of [a previous project](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Fall2017-project2-grp9) from the same class in Fall 2017.

+**Added Functionality**:

We made the map more interactive. For example, users can now be directed to the selected school
website from the map. They can also access quick facts about the school before proceeding to learn more. 
Overall we changed labels to more user-friendly titles. We changed the ordering of the tabs simplifying user navigation. 

Ranking Tab now allows users to select and see more information of the colleges they are interested in. 

Overall Comparison now gives side by side comparison of admission, demographics, tuition, and campus life of different colleges.

Detailed Summary Tab gives visualization of two selected attributes and shows customizable comparisons in an intuitive way. It allows users to access information faster more conveniently. 

Data Exploration Tab shows side by side comparison of Admission stats over the last decade. This gives students an idea of where they currently stand. 

About Us tab allows users could learn more about the functionality of the app and the development team.
